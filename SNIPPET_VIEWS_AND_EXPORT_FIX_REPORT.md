## Test Files Created
- 📝 `test-snippet-views.js` - Comprehensive snippet view testing
- 📝 `test-export-data.js` - Data export functionality testing

## Files Modified

### Frontend
- `/client/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx`
- `/client/src/pages/Projects.jsx` (minor theme fixes)
- `/client/src/pages/Collaborate.jsx`
- `/client/src/pages/Profile.jsx`
- `/client/src/pages/Settings.jsx`
- `/client/src/services/api.js`

### Backend
- `/server/routes/users.js`
- `/server/controllers/userController.js`

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Test the frontend build
cd client && npm run build

# Test backend compilation
cd server && npm start

# Test export functionality
node test-export-data.js

# Test snippet views
node test-snippet-views.js
```

## Usage

### Export Data
1. Go to Settings → Danger Zone
2. Click "Export Data" button
3. File will be downloaded as `devspace-data-export-YYYY-MM-DD.json`
4. Contains all user data in structured JSON format

### Snippet Views
- **Dashboard**: Shows all public snippets with search/filter
- **Projects**: Shows user's own/starred/forked snippets with filters
- **Collaborate**: Shows collaborative snippets with contributor stats
- **Profile**: Shows user's public snippets (or all snippets if own profile)

All pages now have consistent theming, real-time collaboration updates, and proper data normalization.
